            <p class="text-slate-300">
                The Air Quality Index (AQI) is a simple, color-coded scale used by government agencies to communicate how polluted the air currently is or how polluted it is forecast to become. It helps you understand what the local air quality means for your health. The AQI focuses on health effects you may experience within a few hours or days after breathing polluted air.

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-white mb-2">Why is this Project Useful?</h2>
            <p class="text-slate-300">
                While standard AQI reports tell you the current air quality, this project takes it a step further. By using machine learning, <strong>AirWatch</strong> provides:

            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-slate-300 mt-2 space-y-1">
                <li><strong>Real-Time Dashboard:</strong> A single, easy-to-read view of the current AQI, weather, and pollutant breakdown.</li>
                <li><strong>Current AQI Predictions:</strong> If official sensor data isn't available, you can input local pollutant readings to get an estimated AQI.</li>
                <li><strong>7-Day Forecasting:</strong> Our model predicts the AQI for the week ahead, helping you plan activities and take preventive measures before pollution levels rise.</li>
                <li><strong>Personalized Health Tips:</strong> The dashboard provides actionable advice tailored to the current AQI and your context (e.g., at home, outdoors), empowering you to reduce your exposure.</li>
